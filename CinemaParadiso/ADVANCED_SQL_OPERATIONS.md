## Best Practices

1. **Use indexes** on frequently queried columns
2. **Limit results** when testing large datasets
3. **Use EXPLAIN** to analyze query performance
4. **Avoid SELECT *** - specify needed columns
5. **Use JOINs** instead of multiple subqueries when possible
6. **Use CTEs** for complex queries readability
7. **Test queries** in development before production
