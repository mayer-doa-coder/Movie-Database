SELECT MAX(release_date) as newest_movie FROM movies;
SELECT genre, MAX(duration) as longest FROM movies GROUP BY genre;
```

### NVL / COALESCE

```

---

## Joins

### Implicit Join (Comma)
```sql
-- Old style join
SELECT m.title, c.name 
FROM movies m, celebrities c 
WHERE m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### Explicit JOIN ON
```sql
-- Modern join syntax
SELECT m.title, c.name as director
FROM movies m
JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### USING (when column names match)
```sql
-- Simplified join on same column name
SELECT m.title, mc.role
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_cast mc USING (movie_id);
```

### NATURAL JOIN
```sql
-- Auto-join on all matching columns (use cautiously)
SELECT * FROM movies NATURAL JOIN movie_cast;
```

### CROSS JOIN
```sql
-- Cartesian product
SELECT m.title, c.name
FROM movies m
CROSS JOIN celebrities c
LIMIT 10;
```

### INNER JOIN
```sql
-- Only matching records
SELECT m.title, c.name as director
FROM movies m
INNER JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### LEFT OUTER JOIN
```sql
-- All from left table, matching from right
SELECT m.title, c.name as director
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN
```sql
-- All from right table, matching from left
SELECT c.name, m.title
FROM movies m
RIGHT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN
```sql
-- All records from both tables (MySQL workaround with UNION)
SELECT m.title, c.name
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id
UNION
SELECT m.title, c.name
FROM movies m
RIGHT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id;
```

### SELF JOIN
```sql
-- Join table to itself
SELECT u1.username as follower, u2.username as following
FROM user_follows uf
JOIN users u1 ON uf.follower_id = u1.user_id
JOIN users u2 ON uf.following_id = u2.user_id;
```

---

## Set Operations

### UNION
```sql
-- Combine results, remove duplicates
SELECT title, 'Movie' as type FROM movies
UNION
SELECT title, 'Series' as type FROM tv_series;
```

### UNION ALL
```sql
-- Combine results, keep duplicates
SELECT title FROM movies
UNION ALL
SELECT title FROM tv_series;
```

### INTERSECT (MySQL workaround)
```sql
-- Records in both sets
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE genre LIKE '%Drama%'
AND title IN (
    SELECT title FROM movies WHERE genre LIKE '%Crime%'
);
```

### MINUS (MySQL: use NOT IN or NOT EXISTS)
```sql
-- Records in first set but not second
SELECT title FROM movies
WHERE movie_id NOT IN (SELECT content_id FROM watchlist WHERE content_type = 'movie');
```

---

## Subqueries

### Subquery in SELECT
```sql
-- Calculate value for each row
SELECT 
    title, 
    rating,
    (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies) as avg_rating,
    rating - (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies) as diff_from_avg
FROM movies;
```

### Subquery in FROM
```sql
-- Use subquery as table
SELECT genre, avg_rating
FROM (
    SELECT genre, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
    FROM movies
    GROUP BY genre
) as genre_stats
WHERE avg_rating > 8.0;
```

### Subquery in WHERE
```sql
-- Filter using subquery
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE rating > (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies);

SELECT * FROM celebrities
WHERE celebrity_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT celebrity_id FROM movie_cast
);
```

### Correlated Subquery
```sql
-- Subquery references outer query
SELECT m1.title, m1.genre, m1.rating
FROM movies m1
WHERE m1.rating = (
    SELECT MAX(m2.rating)
    FROM movies m2
    WHERE m2.genre = m1.genre
);
```

---

## Advanced Queries

### INSERT INTO SELECT
```sql
-- Insert from query results
INSERT INTO watchlist (user_id, content_type, content_id)
SELECT 1, 'movie', movie_id
FROM movies
WHERE rating > 9.0;
```

### Common Table Expression (CTE) - WITH
```sql
-- Named subqueries
WITH high_rated AS (
    SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rating > 8.5
),
recent AS (
    SELECT * FROM movies WHERE YEAR(release_date) > 2015
)
SELECT * FROM high_rated
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM recent;
```

### Complex Nested Query
```sql
-- Multiple levels of nesting
SELECT 
    m.title,
    m.rating,
    c.name as director,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews r WHERE r.content_type = 'movie' AND r.content_id = m.movie_id) as review_count,
    (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews r WHERE r.content_type = 'movie' AND r.content_id = m.movie_id) as user_rating
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id
WHERE m.rating > (
    SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies WHERE genre = m.genre
)
ORDER BY m.rating DESC;
```

### Window Functions (MySQL 8.0+)
```sql
-- Ranking and partitioning
SELECT 
    title,
    genre,
    rating,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY rating DESC) as genre_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rating DESC) as overall_rank
FROM movies;
```

---

## Views

### CREATE VIEW
```sql
-- Create a virtual table
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW high_rated_movies AS
SELECT m.*, c.name as director_name
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN celebrities c ON m.director_id = c.celebrity_id
WHERE m.rating >= 8.0;
```

### SELECT FROM VIEW
```sql
-- Use view like a table
SELECT * FROM high_rated_movies;
SELECT title, rating FROM high_rated_movies WHERE genre LIKE '%Action%';
```

### UPDATE VIEW
```sql
-- Update underlying table through view
UPDATE high_rated_movies 
SET rating = 9.5 
WHERE title = 'Inception';
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Top Rated Movies by Genre
```sql
SELECT genre, title, rating
FROM movies m1
WHERE rating = (
    SELECT MAX(rating) FROM movies m2 WHERE m1.genre = m2.genre
)
ORDER BY genre;
```

### Users with Most Reviews
```sql
SELECT u.username, COUNT(*) as review_count
FROM users u
JOIN reviews r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.username
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Movies with Cast Details
```sql
SELECT 
    m.title,
    m.rating,
    GROUP_CONCAT(c.name SEPARATOR ', ') as cast_members
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_cast mc ON m.movie_id = mc.movie_id
JOIN celebrities c ON mc.celebrity_id = c.celebrity_id
WHERE mc.cast_type = 'Actor'
GROUP BY m.movie_id, m.title, m.rating
ORDER BY m.rating DESC;
```

### Genre Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
    genre,
    COUNT(*) as movie_count,
    AVG(rating) as avg_rating,
    MIN(rating) as min_rating,
    MAX(rating) as max_rating,
    SUM(total_ratings) as total_user_ratings
FROM movies
GROUP BY genre
HAVING movie_count >= 2
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
