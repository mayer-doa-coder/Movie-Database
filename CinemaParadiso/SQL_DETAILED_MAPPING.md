SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id
```

---

### 56. Self Join: FROM table alias1, table alias2

WITH HighRated AS (
    SELECT title, rating, genre FROM movies WHERE rating >= 8.0
)
SELECT * FROM HighRated ORDER BY rating DESC
```

**Multiple CTEs:**
```sql
WITH 
    MovieStats AS (
        SELECT genre, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
        FROM movies GROUP BY genre
    ),
    SeriesStats AS (
        SELECT genre, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
        FROM tv_series GROUP BY genre
    )
SELECT m.genre, m.avg_rating as movie_avg, s.avg_rating as series_avg
FROM MovieStats m
LEFT JOIN SeriesStats s ON m.genre = s.genre
